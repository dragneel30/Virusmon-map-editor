# Virusmon-map-editor
A map editor I'm working on for a mobile game for college project

"Virusmon" is an undecided name. 

I'm using JUCE library for this. 

JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications. JUCE is used in particular for its GUI and plug-ins libraries.

I'm currently developing this map editor at the same time learning JUCE so this will be a slow development.
