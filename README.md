# Virusmon-map-editor
A map editor I'm working on for a mobile game for college project

"Virusmon" is an undecided name. 

I'm using JUCE library for this.

JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications. JUCE is used in particular for its GUI and plug-ins libraries.

I'm currently developing this map editor at the same time learning JUCE so this will be a slow development.

Initial progress: 03/12/17

-Most are UI of the editor.

-Can now create a new map project.

-Can now make tileset from a texture file. 

New update: 05/12/17

-Can now edit a map.

New update: 05/18/2017 (almost all code has been rewritten)

-Whole UI has been changed

----Tools, map, properties has now their own separate window

-added tools for editing map

-05/22/2017 (2:22pm)
